    "A Thousand Floating Dreams provides Kokomi with Elemental Mastery, making it ideal for a team utilizing Elemental Reactions. Depending on the composition of her team, the weapon's passive can further increase Kokomi's Elemental Mastery and/or Elemental DMG Bonus.",
    "Jadefall's Splendor provides Kokomi with the same stats as Everlasting Moonglow. However, its passive is more restrictive since it can only be activated when Kokomi uses her Elemental Burst. Furthermore, it only provides Energy Recharge and Elemental DMG Bonus, which can be beneficial to increase Kokomi's personal DMG but does little to increase her Healing.",
    "Everlasting Moonglow is Kokomi's signature weapon, and it provides her with the highest HP bonus. Its passive further increases her Healing and personal DMG, while also providing some Energy Recharge.",
    "Mappa Mare provides Kokomi with Elemental Mastery, making it ideal for a team utilizing Elemental Reactions. Its passive increases Kokomi's Elemental DMG when she triggers an Elemental Reaction.",
    "Sacrificial Fragments provides Kokomi with Elemental Mastery, making it ideal for a team utilizing Elemental Reactions. Furthermore, since Kokomi's Elemental Skill applies multiple instances of Ripple DMG, she can easily trigger the weapon's passive to reset her Elemental Skill CD.",
    "Fruit of Fulfillment provides Kokomi with Energy Recharge, while its passive increases her Elemental Mastery when an Elemental Reaction is triggered. The weapon's passive also decreases Kokomi's ATK, but since Kokomi's DMG scales with her HP, this is of little consequence.",
    "Hakushin Ring provides Kokomi with Energy Recharge to burst more easily. Its passive increases Elemental DMG Bonus when an Electro Reaction is triggered. Therefore, this weapon can be best used on a team that can trigger Electro-Charged or Hyperbloom Reactions.",
    "Prototype Amber is the only 4-star weapon with an HP substat. The bonus HP increases Kokomi's Healing and personal DMG, and the weapon's passive will further heal the party when Kokomi uses her Elemental Burst.",
    "Magic Guide provides Kokomi with Elemental Mastery, making it ideal for a team utilizing Elemental Reactions. Furthermore, since Kokomi is a Hydro character, she can utilize the weapons passive to increase her DMG against opponents.",
    "Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers provides Kokomi with an HP boost, which will increase her Healing and personal DMG. When the active party member is switched from Kokomi to another character, this weapon also provides an ATK boost to the new character.",
